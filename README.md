(Start: 4th June 2023)

In this app, the user will be able to add or remove items from a To-Do list as their choice.
This App will have 3 versions:
1. Command line interface 
2. Desktop interface
3. Website interface

The App have five main functionalities:
- add (receives user input): adds a single item to the to-do list;
- show: shows every item of the todo-list;
- edit (receives user input): edits a single item from the to-do list;
- complete (receives user input): risks off an item from the todo-list;
- exit: finish the program.
## 1. Command line interface

_Last update: 12/01/2024_

This is the first usable and fully optimized version of the Todo List App (command-line version). The five concepts (add, show, edit, complete, exit) can be executed simply through the command line.

[//]: # (#### Demonstration:)

[//]: # ()

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If the user types "add", the program will ask for the to-do:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (![add-demo]&#40;readme_imgs/add-demo.png&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Then the user can type "show" to see the enumerated list of to-dos:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (![show-demo]&#40;readme_imgs/show-demo.png&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If the user wants to edit a to-do, they should type "edit", then the app will ask for the number that corresponds to the to-do. After that, it will ask for the new to-do and replace it:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (![edit-demo]&#40;readme_imgs/edit-demo.png&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If the user wants to mark a to-do as complete, they should type "complete" and give the number that corresponds to the to-do &#40;similar to "edit"&#41;:)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (![complete-demo]&#40;readme_imgs/complete-demo.png&#41;)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Finally, if the user wants to exit the app, they should type "exit":)

[//]: # ()
